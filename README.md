# Discord-bot
The repo for the discord bot we use

# Discord-bot
This repo contains the source to the TTJ Discord bot
Coded by primarily [linktlh](https://github.com/linktlh) and [DarthNihilus1](https://github.com/DarthNihilus1)

# Outdated notice:
The bot contained on this repo is severely out of date. It will not run on [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/v1.6.0/) 2.0, you will have to run it on [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/v1.6.0/) 1.6 or older. This repo is for educational and archival purposes only, and should not be used for a current discord bot without major changes. 

It is also worth noting this bot as a whole, was built with a particular set of ideas in place, and not as a general purpose bot. Many things ended up being hard-coded, and will no longer work without changing the values in the code. If you are looking for a bot, please look elsewhere for a starting point.

# Running the bot
You will have to create a config.json, see example_config.json for how it should be setup. Once you have filled out everything, make sure you've installed the dependencies and run the main.py.
